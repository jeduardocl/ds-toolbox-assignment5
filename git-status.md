# Definition: Git status

During the course, we've learned that git status command is very util as it provides information about the current state of the Git reporsitory. 
If we use this command, it will tell you in which branch you are located, and if it is up to date. 
It would also tell you if the changes has been staged or not staged. 

If we want to see this from the Jupyter Lab IDE, we can use the left panel and click in the git extension. 
We'll be able to see eahc file and their status.
